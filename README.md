Exploring Population Growth and the Global Distribution of IUCN Red List Species


Rachel Kenny, Maddie Meltzer, and Paige FitzGibbon

This app will explore the relationship between human population growth and the global distribution of IUCN Red List species. The goal of this app is to help visualize how many and what class of listed species are located in each country, how population has changed over time, and compare number of listed species to projected population growth.
